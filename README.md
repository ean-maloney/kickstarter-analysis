# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for Plays

## Overview of Project
In this project, I examine the successfulness of Kickstarter campaigns in the category "theater" in relation to their launch dates and the success of campaings in the subcategory "plays" in relation to their fundraising goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to predict the launch date and goal amount at which a campaign in the theater/plays category will have the greatest liklihood of success. 

## Analysis and Challenges
One analysis I performed using data from Kickstarter campaigns in the category "theater" concerns the relation between the start date of these campaigns and their eventual outcomes. This relation is depicted in the following graphic.

A second analysis concerned the relation between the fundraising goals of campaigns in the "plays" subcategory. Represented in the following chart are the percentages of campaigns in different goal ranges which were successful, failed, and canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
